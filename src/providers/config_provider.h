 * seeded by a built-in recipe of defaults (RECIPES in config_provider.c). It speaks one wire
 * dialect and resolves its settings from its own subtree overlaid on the recipe. The API key
 * is the one value read from the environment, via a recipe- or config-declared api_key_env:
 * a secret belongs in the environment, not the config file. */

 * receives the count. Names are not filtered against the compiled-in factories; the
